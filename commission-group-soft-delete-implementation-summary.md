# Commission Group Soft Delete Implementation Summary

## Overview
Implemented soft delete functionality for commission groups, allowing admins to "archive" commission groups instead of permanently deleting them. This preserves all historical data while hiding inactive groups from normal operations.

## Database Changes

### 1. Schema Migration
**File:** `database-commission-group-soft-delete-migration.sql`
- Added `is_active` BOOLEAN column to `commission_groups` table with default value `true`
- Added index on `is_active` for better query performance
- Updated existing records to be active

## Backend Changes

### 2. Commission Group Actions
**File:** `src/actions/admin/commissionGroupActions.ts`
- Updated `CommissionGroupWithCounts` type to include `is_active` field
- Modified `fetchCommissionGroupsWithCounts()` to:
  - Accept optional `includeInactive` parameter (defaults to false)
  - Filter by `is_active = true` by default
  - Include `is_active` field in the select query
- Added new `archiveCommissionGroup()` function to set `is_active = false`

### 3. Action Exports
**Files:** `src/actions/adminActions.ts` and `src/actions/index.ts`
- Added `archiveCommissionGroup` to the export lists

## Frontend Changes

### 4. Archive Confirmation Dialog
**File:** `src/components/admin/commissions/ArchiveCommissionGroupDialog.tsx`
- Created reusable dialog component for archive confirmation
- Includes warning icon and detailed explanation of what archiving does
- Shows loading state during archive operation
- Uses orange color scheme to indicate caution

### 5. Commission Group Card Updates
**File:** `src/components/admin/commissions/CommissionGroupOverviewCard.tsx`
- Added trash can delete button in top-right corner
- Button appears on hover with smooth transitions
- Prevents card click when delete button is clicked
- Integrated archive dialog with proper state management
- Added `onArchive` callback prop for refreshing the list

### 6. Main Commissions Page Updates
**File:** `src/pages/admin/commissions/index.tsx`
- Added `refreshCommissionGroups()` function to reload data after archiving
- Passed `onArchive` callback to commission group cards
- Maintains existing functionality while adding archive capability

## Key Features

### User Experience
- **Hover-to-reveal delete button**: Clean interface that shows delete option only when needed
- **Confirmation dialog**: Prevents accidental archiving with clear explanation
- **Loading states**: Visual feedback during archive operation
- **Automatic refresh**: List updates immediately after successful archiving

### Data Integrity
- **Soft delete**: Records are marked inactive, not deleted
- **Historical preservation**: All commission data, rates, and relationships remain intact
- **Reversible**: Can be restored by setting `is_active = true` (future enhancement)
- **Filtered queries**: Inactive groups don't appear in normal listings

### Technical Implementation
- **Consistent patterns**: Follows existing soft delete patterns used for voucher types
- **Type safety**: Full TypeScript support with updated types
- **Error handling**: Proper error states and user feedback
- **Performance**: Indexed queries for efficient filtering

## Usage

### For Admins
1. Hover over any commission group card
2. Click the trash can icon in the top-right corner
3. Review the confirmation dialog explaining the action
4. Click "Archive Group" to confirm or "Cancel" to abort
5. The group disappears from the list immediately upon successful archiving

### For Developers
- Use `fetchCommissionGroupsWithCounts(true)` to include inactive groups
- Archive groups with `archiveCommissionGroup(groupId)`
- All existing functionality remains unchanged

## Future Enhancements
- Add "Archived Groups" section for viewing/restoring inactive groups
- Prevent archiving groups with active retailers assigned
- Add bulk archive operations
- Add audit trail for archive/restore actions

## Database Migration Required
Before deploying, run the SQL migration script:
```sql
-- Run the contents of database-commission-group-soft-delete-migration.sql
```

This implementation provides a safe, user-friendly way to manage commission groups while preserving all historical data for reporting and compliance purposes.
